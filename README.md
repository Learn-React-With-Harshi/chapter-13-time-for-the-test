   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Class Summary `Chapter-13 Time for the test` (05/02/2023)
  We are marching towards the end of the course as well as the project that we are developing. Chapter-13 is all about testing the application. Yes ! Testing is also a part of development, in fact, important part of development which many developers don't do to met deadlines. In this chapter, different types of testing and testing frameworks were discussed. Detailed explanation and hands-on on testing frameworks `jest` and `react-testing-library` were done. We tried to cover test cases for major features of our app. It was again a knowlegde heavy as well as lengthy session.

  Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in [theory-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-13-time-for-the-test/blob/main/theory-assignment.md). Check [coding-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-13-time-for-the-test/blob/main/coding-assignment.md) for all the features that I implemented in this chapter.

One line about this chapter : `Writing testcases & Testing the code are equally important to writing code and developing teh features `
